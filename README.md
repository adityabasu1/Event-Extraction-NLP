## Introduction <br />
Joint-event-extraction is a significant emerging application of NLP techniques which involves extracting structural information (i.e., event triggers, arguments of the event) from unstructured real-world corpora. Existing methods for this task rely on complicated pipelines prone to error propagation. 

## Model Architecture <br />
An encoder-decoder based architecture for joint entity-relation extraction was proposed by [Tapas Nayak et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09886.pdf), and we further develop the architecture to deploy it to predicting ``` trigger```, ```argument``` and ```relation``` tuple (including the ```classes of the trigger and argument```). We also utilise pretrained BERT embeddings to preprocess our data.  <br />

## Datasets <br />
The data is available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1fYP9PUQYRV0JWBa-N3CwuGkOCeBielT9 <br />
To obtain the Word2Vec embeddings and BERT embeddings, download ```'w2v.txt'``` and ```'BERT_embeddings.txt'``` from the aforementioned link. <br />
